        comment: "CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED: PII Scanner has severe over-classification problem. Testing with comprehensive multi-sector DDL (15 tables, 310 columns) revealed 147 fields classified as HIPAA when only ~79 expected. False HIPAA rate is 81.6% - financial, education, and business fields are incorrectly classified as HIPAA instead of PII under GDPR. Healthcare fields (27) are correctly identified as HIPAA, but non-healthcare sensitive fields (120) are falsely classified as HIPAA. This matches user's report of 370 fields classified as HIPAA when only 79 should be. Backend classification logic needs major accuracy improvements to distinguish healthcare context from other sensitive data contexts."

Results: 118 fields processed, 78% false HIPAA rate (92/118 fields incorrectly classified). Healthcare context detection works correctly (26 fields properly classified as HIPAA), but ALL non-healthcare contexts fail: 45 financial fields, 17 education fields, 20 business fields, and 10 system fields ALL incorrectly classified as HIPAA instead of appropriate regulations (GDPR/Non-PII). Backend logs show 'context-determined regulation HIPAA' for ALL fields regardless of table context. The context-aware regulation assignment is completely broken - system applies HIPAA to everything instead of distinguishing healthcare from financial/education/business contexts."

Fix extracts applicable_regulations from scanner results and preserves context-aware regulation assignments. Test results: FALSE HIPAA RATE REDUCED FROM 78% TO 0.0%. Healthcare fields: 26/26 (100%) correctly classified as HIPAA. Non-healthcare fields correctly classified as GDPR: Financial (45), Education (37), Business (20), System (50). Only 3 reasonable edge cases from medical-context tables. The context determination engine was working correctly - the bug was in the result conversion pipeline.

Backend logs show context determination is working correctly - GDPR for non-healthcare fields, HIPAA for healthcare fields. However, line 246 in /app/backend/main.py hardcodes 'applicable_regulations': ['HIPAA', 'GDPR'] for ALL sensitive fields instead of using the actual context-determined regulation. This causes 100% false HIPAA rate (152/152 non-healthcare fields incorrectly show HIPAA). The classification engine correctly identifies 26 healthcare fields as HIPAA and 152 non-healthcare fields with GDPR context, but the conversion function overwrites this with hardcoded regulations.

Results: Healthcare fields correctly classified as HIPAA: 26/26 (100.0%), Non-healthcare fields incorrectly classified as HIPAA: 0/102 (0.0%), Total HIPAA classifications: 29 (close to expected ~26).

Only 3 edge cases from clinical_trial_participants and insurance_claims_processing tables classified as HIPAA, which is reasonable due to medical context (patient_mrn, medical_provider, diagnosis_code). The fix in convert_scanner_result_to_frontend_format function (lines 175-194) now properly extracts and preserves applicable_regulations from scanner results instead of hardcoding regulations.
