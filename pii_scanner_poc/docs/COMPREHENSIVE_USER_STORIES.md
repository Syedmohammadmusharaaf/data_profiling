## Epic 1: Schema Analysis and Classification

### User Story 1.1: DDL File Analysis
**As a** Data Engineer  
**I want to** analyze DDL files for PII/PHI content  
**So that** I can ensure compliance before deploying database schemas  

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System accepts multiple DDL file formats (.ddl, .sql)
- [ ] Analysis completes within 2 minutes for schemas with 1000+ columns
- [ ] Results include confidence scores for each classification
- [ ] System handles Unicode characters and international field names
- [ ] Local pattern recognition achieves â‰¥95% coverage without AI calls

#### Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Analyze standard DDL file
  Given I have a DDL file with user tables containing email and phone fields
  When I submit the file for analysis
  Then the system should identify email and phone as PII with >95% confidence
  And the analysis should complete in <30 seconds
  And the system should use only local patterns (no AI calls)

Scenario: Handle international field names
  Given I have a DDL file with German field names like "benutzer_email"
  When I submit the file for analysis
  Then the system should recognize "benutzer_email" as email PII
  And the confidence score should be >80%

Scenario: Process large enterprise schema
  Given I have a DDL file with 50 tables and 1500 columns
  When I submit the file for analysis
  Then the analysis should complete within 2 minutes
  And the system should maintain >95% local detection rate
  And LLM usage should be <5%
```

#### Edge Cases
- Empty DDL files
- Malformed SQL syntax
- Extremely large files (>100MB)
- Files with mixed character encodings
- DDL files with complex nested structures

### User Story 1.2: Live Database Schema Analysis
**As a** Database Administrator  
**I want to** connect directly to live databases and analyze their schemas  
**So that** I can assess PII/PHI exposure in production systems  

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Supports multiple database types (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
- [ ] Secure connection handling with credential encryption
- [ ] Schema extraction without performance impact on production databases
- [ ] Selective table analysis (include/exclude specific tables)
- [ ] Real-time progress reporting for large databases

#### Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Connect to MySQL database
  Given I have valid MySQL connection credentials
  When I initiate a live database analysis
  Then the system should connect securely without affecting database performance
  And extract all table and column metadata
  And classify sensitive fields using the hybrid engine

Scenario: Selective table analysis
  Given I have a database with 100 tables
  When I specify analysis of only "users" and "customers" tables
  Then the system should analyze only the specified tables
  And provide results within 1 minute
  And maintain security isolation for unanalyzed tables
```

### User Story 1.3: Multi-Regulation Compliance Check
**As a** Compliance Officer  
**I want to** analyze schemas against multiple regulations simultaneously  
**So that** I can ensure comprehensive compliance across jurisdictions  

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Support for GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA regulations
- [ ] Region-specific rule application
- [ ] Comparative compliance reporting
- [ ] Risk level assessment per regulation
- [ ] Actionable remediation recommendations

#### Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Multi-regulation analysis
  Given I have a healthcare database schema
  When I select both GDPR and HIPAA regulations
  Then the system should provide separate compliance assessments for each
  And highlight fields that violate both regulations
  And suggest regulation-specific remediation actions

Scenario: Region-specific compliance
  Given I have a schema for European operations
  When I select GDPR with "EU" region specification
  Then the system should apply EU-specific PII categories
  And provide region-appropriate compliance guidance
```

## Epic 2: AI-Assisted Edge Case Analysis

### User Story 2.1: Intelligent Edge Case Detection
**As a** Data Engineer  
**I want to** leverage AI for ambiguous field classifications  
**So that** I can achieve high accuracy even with non-standard field names  

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AI analysis only for fields below 70% local confidence
- [ ] Multiple prompt strategies (few-shot, chain-of-thought, multi-step)
- [ ] Cost optimization with intelligent prompt selection
- [ ] Fallback to heuristics when AI is unavailable
- [ ] AI usage tracking and cost reporting

#### Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Edge case AI analysis
  Given I have fields like "customer_contact_info" and "user_personal_data"
  When local patterns show <70% confidence
  Then the system should use AI analysis for these fields
  And provide >85% confidence classifications
  And log all AI interactions for audit

Scenario: AI service unavailable fallback
  Given the AI service is temporarily unavailable
  When I analyze a schema with ambiguous fields
  Then the system should use heuristic-based classification
  And clearly mark results as "requires manual review"
  And maintain processing continuity
```

  And the alias should be versioned and logged
  And system performance should not degrade

Scenario: Bulk alias import
  Given I have a CSV file with 100 company-specific aliases
  When I import the aliases through the admin interface
  Then all aliases should be validated and added to the system
